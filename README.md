# 3d-rendering

Just a simple Python 3D rendering project!
Use this code if you like, it'd boost my ego ;D

This is my half assed attempt at making a 3D grphics thingy whatsit.
Hopefully it'll be fun and it'll be a good way to develop my maths 
skills. Anyway don't expect top tier code quality as Python is my 
second language. Peace :D
